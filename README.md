# Big Spender
Modularized SwiftUI app, work in progress, targeted for release April 2023.

To run the app, you need a GoogleService-Info.plist configured with Firebase and Authentication. For Auth you need to add phone authentication, as that is currently the only implemented registration/login flow.
